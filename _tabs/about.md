## Hey! I'm Karthik!

I'm a DevOps engineer and overall pretty cool guy. I currently work for <a href="https://careers.swiggy.com/#/about" target="_blank">Swiggy</a> and live in Bangalore, IN.

In my freetime, I enjoy playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmZ77Yn3Fr4" target="_blank">Ultimate Frisbee</a>, tinkering with gadgets, and learning awesome stuff.

On this site, I write about:

- Projects that I am working on or have worked on.
- Things that I have figured out - hopefully to save others some time.
- Other cool stuff I discover along the way.

**Favorite quote :** Make the easy things simple, and the hard things possible - Larry Wall
